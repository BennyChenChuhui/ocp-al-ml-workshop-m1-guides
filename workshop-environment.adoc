== The Workshop Environment You Are Using

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-installed and are ready to use. Depending on which parts of the
workshop you are doing, you will use one or more of:

* https://www.openshift.com/[Red Hat OpenShift^] - You will use one or more _projects_ (Kubernetes namespaces) that are your own and are isolated from other workshop students
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces^] - based on *Eclipse Che*, it is a cloud-based, in-browser IDE (similar to IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, Eclipse IDE). You’ve been provisioned your own personal workspace for use with this workshop. You will write, test, and deploy code from here.
* https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[Red Hat AMQ Streams^] - streaming data platform based on *Apache Kafka*
* https://buildah.io/[Buildah^] - Buildah is a tool that facilitates building Open Container Initiative (OCI) container images. We will be the tool in this workshop to create models from constructed images.
* https://jupyter.org/[Jupyter Notebook^] - An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook will be used to build, train and test models in this workshop.
* https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[JupyterHub^] - A multi-user Hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server. In this workshop we will be logging into this environment to provision instances of Jupyter Notebook.
* https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines[Tekton^] - An open source project that provides a framework to create cloud-native CI/CD pipelines quickly. We will be creating pipelines based on Tekton in this workshop.
* https://www.openshift.com/blog/configure-openshift-metrics-with-prometheus-backed-by-openshift-container-storage[Prometheus^] - An open-source systems monitoring toolkit for event monitoring and alerting. Prometheus will be collating the metrics from the produced models in this workshop.
* https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/custom-grafana-dashboards-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4[Grafana^] - An open-source visualization and analytics software. In this workshop Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore the metrics collected by Prometheus.
* https://github.com/gogs/gogs[Gogs^] - Gogs is a simple, stable and extensible self-hosted Git service which will be created for the purposes of this workshop.
* https://www.seldon.io/[Seldon^] - Provides a set of tools for deploying machine learning models at scale. In this workshop, Seldon will be used for a variety of purposes including providing endpoints for metric collection and allows us to provide feedback to the created models.
* https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss[Nexus^] - Nexus Repository OSS is an open source repository that supports many artifact formats, including Docker, Java™, and npm. 

You will be provided clickable URLs throughout the workshop to access the services that have been installed for you.
 
== Workshop Flow
 
The goal of this workshop is the delivery of an end-to-end AI/ML solution for fraud detection based on the respective software components and their processes. The main steps are as follows:
 
1) Create an AI/ML model that predicts fraud transactions using Jupyter Notebook.
 
2) To productize the model. Using CodeReady Workspaces provided by Openshift to convert code into python, before delivering it into a pipeline for the process of building, testing and deploying code, mainly in three different environments:
 
* Development Environment: Created models will be converted into python code here via CodeReady Workspaces, where these models will be trained and tested with a mixture of fraudulent and non-fraudulent inputs. Versioning will be done to ensure reproducibility of the model.
* Staging Environment: When the model has undergone all the relevant testing, an image will be created with Buildah and stored in Nexus
* Production Environment: Once the model has been verified to be in proper working condition, it will be promoted to the production environment, where approved images are deployed into the environment.
 
3) Monitoring provided by Prometheus/Grafana provides insight into the credibility of the fraud detection model as well as account for any sanity check on the results derived from the associated data. The visualized metrics reflect any performance degradation of the model, which preempts us to decide on either starting on new experiment iterations or retraining the model with new data, considering the regular evolution of fraud practices in the real world.

== Pipeline
 
A pipeline in software development is an automated process that drives software through a path of building, testing, and deploying code. By automating the process, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent process for how software is deployed. Tools that are included in the pipeline could include compiling code, unit tests, code analysis, security, and installer creation. For containerized environments, this pipeline would also include packaging the code into a container to be deployed across the hybrid cloud. A pipeline is critical in supporting continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes.
 
There is a staging pipeline that is used to build and train the model.

== GPU 

In this workshop, we will not be using GPU to train the models.

GPU is supported on OpenShift via the https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator[Nvidia GPU Operator^] and Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator. The NFD operator identifies hardware device features in nodes. It solves the general problem of identifying and cataloging hardware resources in the infrastructure nodes so they can be made available to OpenShift.

image::nvdia-gpu-operator-manual-install.png[nvdia-gpu-operator-manual-install]

The NFD operator uses vendor PCI IDs to identify hardware in a node and Nivdia uses the PCI ID `10de`. 

[source,sh]
----
$ oc describe node ip-10-0-132-138.us-east-2.compute.internal | egrep 'Roles|10de'

Roles: worker
feature.node.kubernetes.io/pci-10de.present=true
----

`10de` appears in the node feature list for the GPU-enabled node we defined. These labels created by the NFD operator are what the GPU Operator uses in order to determine where to deploy the driver containers for the GPU(s).

You can then consume these GPUs from your containers by https://github.com/openshift-psap/blog-artifacts/blob/master/gpu-operator-pt1/0004-rapids_template.yaml#L67-L71[requesting^] `nvidia.com/gpu` just like you request cpu or memory. 

[source,yaml]
----
resources:
  requests:
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Num of GPUs
  limits:
    nvidia.com/gpu: 1
----         

== Model Training And Serving Frameworks

We will be using Seldon to package the trained model into a Flask app.

In Kubernetes, there are other Custom Resources (CR) such as:

* TensorFlow. https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/tftraining/[TFJob^] provided by https://www.kubeflow.org[Kubeflow^]. You can serve the model directly from S3 or use https://github.com/AICoE/tensorflow-serving-s2i[S2I^].
* Kubeflow XGBoost https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/kubernetes.html[operator^]
* PyTorch https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/training/pytorch/[jobs^] to run distributed training. 

== First Step: Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 900]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidently type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text. Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

The entire workshop is split into one or more _modules_ - Look at the top of the screen in the header to see which module you are on. After
you complete this module, your instructor may have additional modules to complete.

Good luck, and let’s get started!
