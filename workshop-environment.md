You will write, test, and deploy code from here (in your own personal workshop).
* [Red Hat SSO](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on){:target="_blank"} - For authentication / authorization - based on **Keycloak**
* Other open source projects like [Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub){:target="_blank"} (A multi-user Hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server), [Gogs](https://gogs.io/){:target="_blank"} (Git server that holds application source code), [Knative](https://knative.dev){:target="_blank"} (for serverless apps), [Tekton](https://cloud.google.com/tekton/){:target="_blank"} (CI/CD pipelines), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io){:target="_blank"} and [Grafana](https://grafana.com){:target="_blank"} (monitoring apps), and more.

You will be provided clickable URLs throughout the workshop to access the services that have been installed for you.
