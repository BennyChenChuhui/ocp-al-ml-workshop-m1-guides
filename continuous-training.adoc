## Continuous Training With A/B Testing

It is important for us to actively monitor the quality of your model in production. Monitoring allows us to detect performance degradation, thus allowing us to decide whether we should start new experiment iterations or retrain the model with new data. 

In this chapter, you will build a new model, test it in staging and deploy it to production with A/B testing.

## Exploring The New Model

Go to JupyterHub and launch the notebook `{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/notebooks/3 using xgboost.ipynb`. The new model will be based on XGBoost.

XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.

## Build and Test A New Model

We will be using {{ECLIPSE_CHE_URL}}[ CodeReady Workspaces^], and log in using the username and
password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

The model has already been converted for you using `jupytext` and modified to run in the pipeline.

Run the following script to use the new model:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}
git checkout master
cp /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/train/boost.ans.py \
    /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/train/boost.py

cat << EOF > /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/train/config.sh
PYTHON_SCRIPT=boost.py
RUN_NAME=xgboost
EOF

/projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/train/train-dev.sh
----

Run the model:
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cat << EOF > /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/seldon/config.sh
MODEL_NAME=XGBoostModel
IMAGE_NAME=xgboost
EOF

cd /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/seldon/
./app.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
Users may notice the `"Address already in use"` error message when running this command. To remedy this, enter the terminal running the original `app.sh` and press kbd:[CTRL+C] to stop the Flask server first, before running the command again. 
====

Now let's test the model. Open up a *new* terminal and run the following:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
/projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/bin/dev-test.sh
----

The code has been tested and we can now commit to development branch. 
[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
 cd /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/src/train
 git add *.py
 git commit -a -m "my xgboost model"
 git push -v origin master
----

The code has now been pushed to {{GIT_URL}}/{{USER_ID}}/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}[your^] git
repository.

## Deploy to Staging With A/B Testing

We will now build the image for staging. Once the code is pushed to the `stage` branch, the pipeline will run. 

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
 cd /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}
 git checkout stage
 git merge master 
 git push -v origin stage
----
You can go to OpenShift Console to monitor the {{CONSOLE_URL}}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-stage/tekton.dev\~v1alpha1~PipelineRun[pipeline run^].

Once the pipeline runs finish, we will modify the `SeldonDeployment` to do A/B testing in staging.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd /projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}
git checkout tags/v1.0 -b v1.0
GIT_REV=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`
echo "GIT REVISION: $GIT_REV"
. src/seldon/config.sh

PREV_IMAGE_NAME=$IMAGE_NAME
PREV_GIT_REV=$GIT_REV

git checkout stage
GIT_REV=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`
. src/seldon/config.sh

cd /projects/{{USER_DEPLOY_REPO_NAME}}
git checkout master

sed -e "s/_USER_/{{USER_ID}}/g" \

-e "s/_PREV_GIT_REV_/$PREV_GIT_REV/g" \
-e "s/_IMAGE_NAME_/$IMAGE_NAME/g" \
-e "s/_GIT_REV_/$GIT_REV/g" \
seldon-model-ab.yaml.tmpl > seldon.yaml

git commit -a -m "a/b testing with $PREV_IMAGE_NAME:$PREV_GIT_REV and $IMAGE_NAME:$GIT_REV"
git checkout stage
git merge master

git push -v origin
----

You can login to {{ARGOCD_URL}}/applications/{{USER_ID}}-stage[Argo CD^] with your `{{USER_ID}}/{{OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD}}` credential to monitor the deployment. 

There will be 2 classifier pods deployed in your {{CONSOLE_URL}}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-stage/pods/[{{USER_ID}}-stage project^].

After the new model has been deployed to OpenShift, you can now run some basic tests

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
/projects/{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/bin/stage-test.sh
----

Now go to {{CONSOLE_URL}}/k8s/ns/{{USER_ID}}-stage/pods[OpenShift Console^] to view the pod logs. Observe that credit card transactions have been sent to both pods by calling the `/predict` endpoints.

## Deploy To Production With A/B Testing

We will now promote this new image to the Production environment and run some tests.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
cd /projects/{{USER_DEPLOY_REPO_NAME}}
git checkout prod
git merge stage
git push -u -v origin
----

After the new model has been deployed to OpenShift, you can run some basic tests.
