Introduction to OpenShift UI
============================

This module provides a brief overview of the OpenShift Web Console.


Logging into An OpenShift Cluster
=================================

The OpenShift cluster web console login page prompts user for their Username and Password

![openshift_ui_login]({% image_path openshift-ui-login.png %})

We will be presented with a `Welcome to OpenShift` message and the option of creating a new project

![welcome_to_openshift]({% image_path welcome-to-openshift.png %})


Creating a New Project
======================
Proceed to create a new project by selecting `Create Project`

![openshift_create_new_project]({% image_path openshift-create-new-project.png %})

Upon creating a project you will be left on the overview page for the new project.

If you want to get to a list of all the projects that are available, you can select `Home->Projects` from the side menu on the left. You can click on the hamburger menu item button on the top left corner of the web console if you do not see the side menu.
