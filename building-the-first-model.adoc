== Build Your First Model

In this module, you will begin to use Jupyter Notebook to build, train
and test the model.

== Logging in

Begin by logging into link:{{JUPYTERHUB_URL}}[JupyterHub^].

Your user name will be `{{  USER_ID }}` and password is
`{{  OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`.

Upon logging in, start a new notebook by choosing
`rh-mlops-workshop-notebook:3.6` image in the drop down box and then click on
`Spawn`. Leave the rest of the options as default.

[NOTE]
====
If the notebook page did not appear, try refreshing the page or reach
out to your instructor.
====

Once the notebook page is up and running, click on
`{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/notebooks/2 building the first model.ipynb` to load the notebook.

After running notebook “2 building the first model”, the output would be similar to the example below.
